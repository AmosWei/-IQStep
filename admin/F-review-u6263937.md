Review Comments:


1. Piece.java: The idea of creating an enum class is quite smart. This makes it easy to manipulate through the pieces and
    board state.

2. Piece.java: In the whole class (and others), He created variable names that are clear and easily understood. This follows
    the java programming convention well.

3. Piece.java: 35, 84, 119, 140, 222 The class has concrete comments. And it was constructed from the setting of default
    values to the different methods that change the default values into final version. The code is well-structured.

4. Piece.java: There are maps and arrayLists in this class which have different functions. He chose them carefully so that
    it works efficiently. The code demonstrates a skilled use of java collections.

5. Piece.java: 25-27 Some variables are created as static variables outside methods, so that it's the code is readable and
    the variables can be accessed and edited conveniently.
