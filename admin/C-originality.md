We declare that the work we have submitted for Stage C of this assignment and all stages before it is entirely our own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of using <...> to make the game run faster came from a discussion with <...> (noted in source code comments)

* The code in class <...> is based on a solution we found when researching the problem (URL provided in source code comments)

*  Task #4: Assignment 1 of COMP1110 class; we based our code and layout of code on the code from the ass-1 gui.
   We made our own modifications to suit the purpose for assignment 2, but the basics of how to manipulate images and display them on JavaFX came from
   looking at ass-1 code.
*  Task #4: JavaFX lecture code for how to draw shapes and add text.
